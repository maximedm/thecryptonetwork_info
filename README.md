# Wallets
## 💼 How do wallets work?
Even though the name says it, a wallet is not directly a wallet in which you store your crypto assets. Your cryptos are stored on the blockchain and in order to perform transactions or access them in general - you need your private keys. These keys are stored and kept in your wallet. But not only the private key, also the public key is stored there. The public key is used to send and receive cryptocurrencies.

⚠️ CAUTION: Never give the private key to another person, the public key can be given to people at any time without hesitation.

## 🔒 Different wallet types:
There are different types of wallets, for example, the cold wallet, hot wallet and hard wallet. The difference is quite simple. The hot wallet (also called a soft wallet) is a wallet that has a constant connection to the internet (e.g. Exodus, Coinbase) -- the cold wallet is usually one that is offline (e.g. paper wallet). Last but not least there are hard wallets (often called a cold wallet), which are mostly USB stick like hardware devices and combine the functions of hot and cold wallet.

## 🧊 Cold wallet (Paper wallet):
A secure way to store your private keys is paper wallets. As the name suggests, they are made of paper. On the paper are the private key, public key and QR codes. Even though this type of wallet does not sound secure, it is more secure than hot wallets. Since there is no constant connection to the Internet and device, you are protected from viruses. However, there are several problems. In case of fire, the paper burns completely, it is also easy to lose and can be damaged quickly. Since it is not password protected, third parties can gain access to your assets on the spot. We recommend keeping your paper wallet in a safe or other secure places.

## 🔐 Hard wallet:
Hard wallets are also referred to by many simply as cold wallet. Most hard wallets have similarities to USB sticks. These combine the capabilities of the cold wallet and hot wallet. In addition to the hardware device, the app is also required. Transactions made via the app must be confirmed again on the stick. In principle, a hot wallet is one that stores the keys on your cold wallet. The best known hard wallet is a Ledger.

## 🔥 Hot wallet (Soft wallet):
These are e.g. apps or web extensions. Your keys are protected with user-defined passwords. The advantages of hot wallets are that you can always have them with you (on your cell phone or your computer). The interface is mostly user-friendly and you can easily send and receive cryptos. Most wallets offer the ability to store multiple keys of different assets (paper wallets usually only 1 asset). However, you are an easy victim of viruses that are on your PC. If you ever lose your phone or your PC stops working -- you can restore your wallet with the words assigned at the beginning (most 12 or 24). Your cryptos will not be lost in this process! Well-known hot wallets are Exodus, Trust wallet or Coinbase.

# Staking, Compound, and Yield Farming
## 💰 Staking:
Staking is where you leave the token or coin in the liquidity of the project's protocol, and earn passively with a % in return.

## 💹 Compound:
Compound is where your tokens are being consistently compounded daily, with a larger APY at the end of the year.

## 🌾 Yield Farming:
Yield Farming is similar to everything else, but the interest rates are higher, there are also different stages, where you can improve from, and the supplier here is where it gets determined.
